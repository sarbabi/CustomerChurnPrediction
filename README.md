# CustomerChurnPrediction
Implement my learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.
The business problem is: how do we identify (and later intervene) the customers who are likely to churn.
\brThe complete project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented and tested). The code will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).
